# AI Security Posture Management Platform - Service Mesh Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive technical overview of the AI-SPM platform architecture, featuring Istio service mesh for enterprise security, observability, and traffic management.

## Architecture Overview

The AI Security Posture Management platform implements a **hybrid microservices architecture with Istio service mesh** that combines the strengths of Node.js for web services with Python's rich AI/ML ecosystem for specialized security tasks. The service mesh layer provides automatic mTLS encryption, fine-grained authorization policies, and comprehensive observability across all services, creating a zero-trust security architecture optimized for enterprise environments.

## Design Principles

### 1. Zero Trust Service Mesh Architecture
**Istio Service Mesh**: Provides automatic mTLS, service identity, and policy enforcement for all inter-service communication.
**Zero Trust Security**: No implicit trust between services; every request must be authenticated and authorized.

### 2. Hybrid Language Architecture
**Node.js for Web Services**: Optimized for high-throughput HTTP handling, real-time communications, and frontend integration.
**Python for AI/ML Tasks**: Leverages the extensive Python ecosystem for machine learning, data analysis, and security algorithms.

### 3. Microservices with Service Mesh Integration
Each service has a single responsibility with Envoy proxy sidecars providing:
- Automatic mTLS encryption
- Load balancing and circuit breaking
- Distributed tracing and metrics collection
- Traffic management and policy enforcement

### 4. Declarative Security Policies
Security configurations defined as code using Istio CRDs:
- PeerAuthentication for mTLS enforcement
- AuthorizationPolicy for fine-grained access control
- NetworkPolicy for additional network isolation

### 5. Comprehensive Observability
Service mesh provides automatic observability:
- Distributed tracing across all services
- Metrics collection without code instrumentation
- Access logs with security context
- Service topology visualization

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Service Mesh Layer (Istio)
**Technology Stack**: Istio 1.20+, Envoy Proxy, Kubernetes
**Purpose**: Secure service-to-service communication and traffic management

The service mesh provides:
- **Automatic mTLS**: Zero-configuration mutual TLS between all services
- **Service Identity**: Cryptographic identity with automatic certificate rotation
- **Authorization Policies**: Fine-grained access control and zero-trust security
- **Traffic Management**: Advanced routing, load balancing, and fault injection
- **Observability**: Distributed tracing, metrics collection, and access logging

### 2. Frontend Layer (React + TypeScript)
**Technology Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
**Purpose**: Modern, responsive user interface for security professionals

The frontend provides a comprehensive dashboard for managing AI security posture with role-based access control and real-time updates. External traffic enters through the Istio Gateway with TLS termination.

### 3. API Gateway (Node.js + Express + Envoy)
**Technology Stack**: Node.js 18+, Express.js, TypeScript, Passport.js, Envoy Sidecar
**Purpose**: Centralized request handling, authentication, and service orchestration

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, authorization, and routing to appropriate microservices through the service mesh. Each request is automatically traced and secured with mTLS.

### 4. Python Microservices (FastAPI + Envoy)
**Technology Stack**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic, Uvicorn, Envoy Sidecar
**Purpose**: Specialized AI/ML security processing with mesh integration

Four independent microservices handle specific AI security domains:
- **AI Scanner Service**: Model vulnerability assessment and bias detection

All microservices communicate through the service mesh with automatic mTLS encryption and authorization enforcement.

### 5. Database Layer (PostgreSQL + Envoy)
**Technology Stack**: PostgreSQL 13+, Drizzle ORM, Connection Pooling, Envoy Sidecar
**Purpose**: Centralized data persistence and management

The database stores all application data including user accounts, asset inventory, vulnerability findings, compliance assessments, and audit trails. Database connections are secured through the service mesh.
