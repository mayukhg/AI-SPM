Priority: High

Feature ID: THREAT-001
Name: Advanced Adversarial Attack Detection & Mitigation

Description: Implement and operationalize advanced detection mechanisms for adversarial attacks (e.g., data poisoning, model evasion, membership inference, attribute inference) with real-time alerting and automated response actions (e.g., blocking malicious inputs, quarantining affected models). This goes beyond the current mock APIs.

Priority: High

Feature ID: AGENTIC-001
Name: Full Agentic Workflow Execution & Monitoring

Description: Fully implement the Agent Orchestration Service and MCP Security Gateway to enable the creation, execution, and real-time monitoring of autonomous AI agent workflows. This includes secure external action control (e.g., API calls, database modifications) with human-in-the-loop approval for high-risk actions.

Priority: High

Feature ID: COMPL-001
Name: Automated Compliance Evidence Collection & Reporting

Description: Enhance compliance assessment workflows to automatically collect evidence (e.g., configuration files, audit logs, scan results) and generate comprehensive, exportable compliance reports (PDF, Excel) for frameworks like NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, and GDPR.

Priority: High

Feature ID: SIEM-001
Name: Bidirectional SIEM Integration & Alert Enrichment

Description: Implement full bidirectional integration with SIEM platforms (Splunk, QRadar, Sentinel) to not only forward alerts but also ingest threat intelligence, enrich alerts with SIEM context, and enable automated response actions triggered from the SIEM.

Priority: High

Feature ID: DATA-001
Name: Real-time Data Integrity & Drift Monitoring

Description: Operationalize real-time data quality validation, anomaly detection, and data drift monitoring for AI training and inference datasets. Implement alerts for significant data integrity issues that could impact model performance or security.

Priority: High

Feature ID: AUTH-001
Name: Full Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Integration

Description: Complete the implementation of TOTP-based MFA for all user roles, including setup, verification, and recovery options, ensuring a robust second layer of authentication.

Priority: High

Medium Priority Features (Strategic Growth & Deepening Capabilities)
These features expand the platform's value, offer more advanced analytics, or integrate with a broader ecosystem, contributing to strategic growth.

Feature ID: MLOPS-001
Name: MLOps & DevSecOps Pipeline Integration

Description: Develop deeper integrations with popular MLOps platforms (Kubeflow, MLflow, Vertex AI, SageMaker) and CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to embed automated security checks (SAST/SCA for AI code, model scanning) directly into development and deployment pipelines.

Priority: Medium

Feature ID: AISEC-001
Name: AI Supply Chain Security Management

Description: Implement features to assess and manage risks associated with third-party AI models, pre-trained foundation models, open-source libraries, and external data sources used in the AI supply chain. Provide a clear "AI Bill of Materials (AIBOM)" for each asset.

Priority: Medium

Feature ID: PRIV-001
Name: Automated Data Subject Rights (DSR) Fulfillment

Description: Automate the processing of Data Subject Rights requests (e.g., access, deletion, portability) for data handled by AI systems, ensuring compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

Priority: Medium

Feature ID: ANALYTICS-001
Name: Predictive AI Risk Assessment

Description: Develop AI-powered analytics to identify emerging AI attack vectors, predict potential vulnerabilities, and proactively recommend countermeasures based on historical data and threat intelligence.

Priority: Medium

Feature ID: THREAT-002
Name: AI Firewall Capabilities (Prompt/Output Filtering)

Description: Implement AI-specific firewall functionalities to inspect and filter inbound prompts (for LLMs) and outbound responses, blocking malicious inputs (e.g., prompt injection, SQL injection via prompts), unauthorized queries, data scraping, and harmful outputs.

Priority: Medium

Feature ID: OPS-001
Name: Customizable Dashboards & Reporting Templates

Description: Provide advanced customization options for dashboards, allowing users to create role-specific views and tailor reporting templates to their specific organizational needs and compliance requirements.

Priority: Medium

Low Priority / Future Features (Long-Term Vision & Advanced Research)
These features represent the long-term vision and may require significant research and development, or depend on future market maturity.

Feature ID: XAI-001
Name: Explainable AI (XAI) Integration for Security

Description: Integrate XAI techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP) to provide deeper insights into why an AI model is flagged as vulnerable or behaving anomalously, aiding in root cause analysis and remediation.

Priority: Low

Feature ID: BLOCKCHAIN-001
